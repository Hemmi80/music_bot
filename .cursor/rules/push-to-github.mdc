# Always push to GitHub

When you edit files in this project:

1. Stage all relevant changes (`git add`).
2. Commit with a clear message describing the change.
3. Push to the default remote branch (e.g. `git push origin main`).

Do this as part of the same task—don’t leave uncommitted or unpushed changes unless the user asks otherwise.
